# Piwalker-NDVI-Processing

We used this code in our project to process our images that we got from the ISS. The programm takes images taken in the NIR-spectrum and converts them to NDVI color maps that can be used for analysis.

This program was written based on a guide at: https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astropi-ndvi.

The program is called ndvi.py and can be run on a windows machine. The original plan was to run the code on the Raspberry Pi, but due to some issues while installing the libraries needed for the program we decided to run it on a windows machine instead.
