# Piwalker-NDVI-Processing

We used this code in our project to process our images that we got from the ISS. The programm takes images taken in the NIR-spectrum and converts them to NDVI color maps that can be used for analysis.

This programm was written based on a guide at: https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astropi-ndvi.
